## 🧠 What is a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is a place where ideas grow and evolve. It's a bit like a blog, but with less pressure to be perfect and more room for exploration. You'll find unfinished ideas, notes, and references that I use to think through problems.

Feel free to browse around, click on links, and see where they take you!
